# Show My Pictures

This project was created based on the challenge of Day 50 of the 100 Days of Swift by Hacking With Swift (Paul Hudson).

The challenge was to develop an iOS App that would allow the user to load pictures from his device into a table, using picker.

Then the pictures would be clickable and the user would be able to see them on a new screen, rename or delete them.

All the info loaded into the table was saved on the device, so it was still available when the user returned to the app.

You can check the actual challenge page on the references.
